Paragraphs are just a bunch of sentences separated
by a blank line. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur 
adipiscing elit. Nullam.

See, this is another paragraph. Lorem ipsum dolor sit 
amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam.

Sometimes, you want to force a line break.  In this case, 
put two spaces at the end of a line  
ad do you see the line break?

You can add a horizontal rule like this:

You can also set the font on text.  For example, 
_these words are italicized_, 
on some systems, *these worlds might be italicized*, 
**these words are bolded**, 
and finally, `the words use a monospace font`.

You can have bulleted lists:

  * HTML
  * CSS
  * HavaScript

You also can have numbered lists:

  1. HTML
  2. CSS
  3. JavaScript

You can add links.  For more information, click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)

If you want to add formatted code to markdown, use backticks before and after it like this:

```
<!DOCTYLE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- body markup goes here -->
  </body>
</html>
```

And to add an image, try this:  
![Image](images/readme-images/dana.jpg "icon")
